# Sumana-Devanagari
Sumana Devangari is a family of devanagari fonts for text setting and web usage. 
Designed by Alexei Vanyashin in 2014-2015 for Cyreal.

The Latin counterpart is derived from Lora by Olga Karpushina, Cyreal. Its vertical and horizontal metrics are adjusted
to better match the scripts together. 

The original name for this project was borrowed from its Latin counterpart, but later, considering the
change in vertical metrics, the naming had to differentiate. The meaning of Sumana in Sankrit is flower, 
which is identical to the meaning of Lora in Spanish. 

It was quite a challenge to match the graphical characteristics of each script and took many iterations
to finalise the first release. I tried to keep the devanagari closer to the traditional calligraphic model 
while flavouring it with graphic solutions derived from the Lora font. 

It is my first attempt to design a devanargi, and I am thankful to Dave Crossland for making this project happen, 
and to all experts who consulted me on this project, including: Fiona Ross, Eric McLaughlin, Vaishnavi Murthy, 
Pria Ravichandran, WeiH
